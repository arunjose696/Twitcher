HOW IT WORKS:
A friendly user interface for beginners, Firstly after start opening the app there are two tabs or feature to “Add a Bird” (For Bird Watcher) and the second is for viewing all the birds list.
By Clicking on the “Add a Bird” tab here the user will add the information about the bird like its name, description (about family, geographic region, species etc.)
Under this feature we can take the Bird Photo by clicking on the Camera Feature which  is classified using AI Model to get the bird’s name which user can change.
Whenever I take picture by using the Machine Learning Model it automatically picks the bird’s name.
By Clicking on the tab “ View All Bird” here the user will find or view the list of the birds with their name, picture, date, time, category, description.
Under the “View All Bird” tab there is an addition feature of “Wiki Link” where the user knows more about the bird.
A Toggle Bar for Wikipedia Link where I can know more about the bird (its species, family, scientific name, geographical region etc).
